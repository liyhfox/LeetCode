Description:
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        bool findPos = false;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            if (num & (1 << i)) findPos = true; // found the highest 1 bit
            if (findPos) num ^= (1 << i);
        }
        return num;
    }
};
